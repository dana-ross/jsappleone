Apple I emulator in Javascript w/canvas

Current status: Computer section emulation ~60% complete. Terminal section emulation ~90% complete. You can see the monitor ROM running in the browser's console. The terminal just displays what you type at the moment, like the original "TV Typewriter" that Woz based it on.
